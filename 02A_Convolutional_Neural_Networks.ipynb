    "In such a system, we store 3 tables of pixel intensities (each called a *channel*), one each for the colors red, green, and blue (hence RGB), resulting in an $H \\times W \\times 3$ tensor.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we've primarily been building neural networks with the TensorFlow Core API, the lowest level of abstraction.\n",
    "This gives the user the finest amount of control over the TensorFlow graph, as well as providing the clearest picture of what's going on under the hood.\n",
    "This can be important as you're learning concepts and the various frameworks, and sometimes the flexibility is necessary if you're trying to build something outside of the standard models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of the time, we do find ourselves repeating the same fairly standard lines of code, which can slow us down. \n",
    "Worse, it clutters up our code unnecessarily and introduces room for bugs and typos.\n",
    "And finally, as researchers or engineers, we would like to spend most of our time thinking on the highest levels of abstractions: I want to add a convolution layer here, then a fully connected there, etc.\n",
    "Having to code all the small details are distractions that can detract from our ability to translate ideas into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, several people have built high level APIs on top of TensorFlow, with Keras, tf.layers, and TF-Slim* being notable examples.\n",
    "We'll briefly touch on TF-Slim and tf.layers here, but we encourage you to look into the options and decide which best suit your needs and preferences.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### VGG-16\n",
    "To illustrate what I mean about levels of abstraction, let's consider [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556). This style of architecture came in 2nd during the 2014 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge and is famous for its simplicity and depth. The model looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The architecture is pretty straight-forward: simply stack multiple 3x3 convolutional filters one after another, interleave with 2x2 maxpools, double the number of convolutional filters after each maxpool, flatten, and finish with fully connected layers. A couple ideas behind this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of using larger filters, VGG notes that the receptive field of two stacked layers of 3x3 filters is 5x5, and with 3 layers, 7x7. Using 3x3's allows VGG to insert additional non-linearities and requires fewer weight parameters to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Doubling the width of the network every time the features are spatially downsampled (maxpooled) gives the model more representational capacity while achieving spatial compression.\n",

As such, the availability of weights already pre-trained on ImageNet has significantly accelerated and democratized deep learning research.\n",
